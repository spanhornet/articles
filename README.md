## Artbrush

This project brings together a modern web stack for building full-stack applications. The following is a brief rundown of the technologies used across the backend and frontend, and why they make this setup awesome:

#### 🔷 TypeScript
Type-safe JavaScript across the stack — enabling better developer tooling, fewer runtime bugs, and more self-documenting code.

#### 📦 PNPM
A fast, disk-efficient package manager with strict dependency isolation. PNPM helps keep node_modules lean and reproducible across the monorepo.

#### 🌪️ Turborepo
A high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. Speeds up development with caching, task pipelines, and remote builds.

#### ⚛️ Next.js
The React framework of choice — supports SSR, API routes, image optimization, and more. It's powering the frontend for fast, SEO-friendly web apps.

#### 🧩 Shadcn/ui
A beautiful, customizable component library built on Radix UI. It offers accessible and flexible components with a developer-first design system.

#### 🔌 Express
A minimalist and performant Node.js web framework for building robust APIs quickly and with fine-grained control.

#### 🔐 Better-Auth
An internal authentication solution for managing secure, scalable auth flows across services. Handles tokens, sessions, and user identity with ease.

#### 🧬 Supabase
Open-source Firebase alternative with a Postgres core. Provides authentication, database, storage, and real-time subscriptions out of the box.

#### 🧾 Drizzle ORM
A type-safe SQL ORM for TypeScript. Offers auto-completion, migrations, and compile-time query validation — no more mystery SQL bugs.

#### 🐳 Docker
Containerization for consistent environments from development to production. Ensures everything runs the same everywhere.

#### 🌐 Render
A modern cloud platform to host apps and databases. Simple Git-based deployments with built-in SSL, scaling, and cron jobs.

#### 🐖 Porkbun
A user-friendly domain registrar used for managing custom domains affordably and efficiently.

#### ☁️ Cloudflare DNS
Lightning-fast DNS resolution and global distribution. Enhances reliability and reduces latency for domain name lookups.
